# CrypVideo - Blockchain Video Sharing Platform

CrypVideo is a decentralized video sharing platform designed to empower content creators and viewers by leveraging blockchain technology. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, CrypVideo offers a secure, transparent, and fair monetization solution through a tipping mechanism using USD-to-ETH conversion. This repository contains the code, setup instructions, and technical details for deploying and running CrypVideo locally.

## Project Overview

CrypVideo provides a decentralized platform where:

Creators can upload and manage videos securely on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).
Viewers can discover, view, and tip creators using Ethereum-based smart contracts.
This project promotes fair monetization, secure content storage, and enhanced user privacy through blockchain technology.

## Features

Decentralized Storage: All video content is stored on IPFS for censorship resistance and security.

Ethereum Tipping System: Enables fair and transparent tipping using smart contracts and MetaMask integration.

User Profiles: Customizable profiles for content creators and viewers.

Secure Authentication: Blockchain-based authentication for enhanced security.

## Requirements

Node.js (v14 or above)

NPM (v6 or above)

Hardhat (local Ethereum network)

MetaMask browser extension

IPFS (for decentralized content storage)

Ensure these are installed and configured on your machine before proceeding.

## Installation and Setup
To set up CrypVideo locally, follow these steps:

1.Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yonatanref007/blockchain.git
cd blockchain
```

2.Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
3.Set Up Metamask:

Add MetaMask to your browser, and configure it to connect to a local Ethereum network (e.g., localhost:8545) to interact with your Hardhat node.

4.Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project root to store sensitive configurations, such as API keys or private keys, required by the application.

## Running the Project
To run the CrypVideo platform locally:

1.Start Local Blockchain Network:

Navigate to the project location and in the terminal, run:
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
2.Compile and Deploy Contracts:

Open a new terminal and compile the smart contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```
Deploy the contracts to the local network:
```bash
npx hardhat run public/smart_contracts/hardhat.js --network localhost
```
3.Start the Development Server:
```bash
npm start
```
4.Access the Platform:
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (/3002).

You should now see CrypVideo running locally. Use your MetaMask wallet to interact with the tipping features and test various functionalities.

## Smart Contracts
The platformâ€™s core tipping functionality is enabled by Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring secure and transparent transactions. These contracts handle the USD-to-ETH conversion, tipping, and content ownership verification. Contracts are written in Solidity and deployed through Hardhat.
